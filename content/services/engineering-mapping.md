GIS in the Design and Construction of Projects

**Airstrip Surveys**

*In depth knowledge of rural aerodromes in Papua New Guinea, our service utilizes drone imagery and soil testing that is conducted in compliance with CASAPNG advisory circular 196 for rural airstrips.*

**Transportation**

*Knowing if a new road network will ease congestion and improve connectivity in a city is important. Our service will optimize connectivity nodes and produce predictive outputs to test project output and expected results before any construction is made. This helps in refining designs before implementation.*
