With the current trend in climate change development initiatives and government development goals, we tackle pressing environmental issues with our knowledge and skills in mapping these phenomena through the following services:

**Flood Modelling**

*Take a proactive approach to managing disasters with our flood modeling analysis. With this service, we can model various flooding scenarios to identify populations and infrastructure at risk and target areas for preventative flood embankment development or monitoring.*

**Landslide Susceptibility**

*Obtain an understanding of surrounding topography with our landslide susceptability analysis of slopes. This services utilizies data obtained obtained within the area from historical data and then uses machine learning methods to predict likely areas for landslide occurence.*

**Rooftop solar power output**

*Free energy from the sun to provide lighting for your home, business or activity is the greenest anthropogenic activity that can be done. However, to yield the most of this solar potential, knowing where to position your solar panels will make the difference in maximising this resource. This service identifies ideal solar potential locations on your roof using drone and satellite imagery.*

**Coral Reef Mapping and Monitoring (Remote Sensing Application)**

*Monitoring fish stocks and recovery is vital in fisheries. Therefore with this service, our knowledge in GIS and remote sensing makes monitoring these reef complexes cheaper and by covering large extents of the ocean with Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. We can identify benthic reef assemblages and measure total area covered. There is also the possibilities to detect coral bleaching events and to monitor this on a temporal scale.*

**Forestry and Agricultural Studies (Remote Sensing Application)**

*Yield forestry and other agricultural metrics from our service such as:*

*- vegetation/crop health*

*- logging and deforestation*

*- carbon Sequestration*

**Urban Heat**

*As rising global temperatures continue to rise, urban cities will experience higher temperatures. Gaining insights into urban temperatures is paramount in developing infrastructure that will be resilient. Our service utilizes satellite imagery to measure urban heat. This analysis will identify hot spots in the city which would not have been identified with other lesser known methods. Insights from this will provide informed decisions to city planners in reducing urban heat.*
